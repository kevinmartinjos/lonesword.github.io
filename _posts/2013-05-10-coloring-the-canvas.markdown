I thought it was time somebody started painting on the canvas. Its been a couple of months since I wrote this program and it was lying in a corner of my hard disk all along. Realized kevinkoder.tk is pretty low on contents and decided to add it to the site.

And the source code can be viewed by pressing ctrl+u (in chrome). But I must warn you though - I've put absolutely zero effort into making the code readable. I'm pretty sure even I can't make sense of it right now. I was in a hurry to do something with processing and thought "Hey, lets make a paint program". The development came to an abrupt stand still when i tried to implement the 'fill bucket' tool using the flood fill algorithm - the damn thing simply refused to work the way I wanted it to.

Anyways, the program proves beyond all doubt that a lot of amazing things are simply doable with processing.

And I had to choose not to include a lot of additional libraries that might have made it a lot easier to develop the program (like a java library that can add additional drawing layers) because 3rd party processing java libraries are incompatible with processing.js , ie, they wont work when you convert the processing code into javascript.

A few handy 'features' were added to compensate for the ultimate pathetic-ness of the program. More info can be found in the documentation.
