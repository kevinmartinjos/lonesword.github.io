Steam rocks! Playing monochrome demo in linux mint, steam client. I move my hand to the side vent, and is that my graphics card heating up? Couldn't be! (teary eyed and feeling grateful)

No lags, and graphics quality set to highest. Ok, monochrome is not THAT heavy. But hey, it's a AAA title and it's running on linux!
