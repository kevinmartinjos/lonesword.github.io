I had a sudden itch to build something from the ground up. I knew the moment it started to itch that the itch will not be cured until I sink hours into something laborious and intellectually satisfying. I wanted to build a company from the ground up. If a stupid photo sharing app like instagram could make so much money despite bringing almost zero utility to the user, I'm pretty sure *anything* can make money. On hindsight I realise that I might be just another clueless programmer who can't figure out how the hell instagram, vine, yo, and whatsapp made so much money. I mean come on, did the world really need another texting service? Or another photosharing service when there was facebook, flickr and a whole ton other services? Don't even get me started on [yo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_%28app%29). I admit it. I'm just jealous. I *know* that instagram is engineered well. 

Anyways, my glorious new "startup" would be called "Use my space". It's kind of very very similar to airBnb but different. I won't pretend that I came up with an idea that is *nothing* like AirBnb and serves a completely different user base. That's not true.

*Gist: you get to rent out soccer ground for a weekend brawl with friends, a rusty old shed for your hardware project e.t.c*

It's sunday noon and the infinite pool of passion and vigour that I assumed I had to bring my idea to life is seeming to dry up. I'm already not-optimistic, though not entirely pessimistic. However, I had put together a couple of screens yesterday night to create a UI prototype so that I can *pitch* to probable *co-founders*. Oh what a fallacy. Here are the screens. Proof that I was willing to put on the designer hat for the sake of a product.

*All screens made using inkscape on ubuntu*
