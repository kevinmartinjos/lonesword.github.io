Remember me ranting about that free domain name? Well I've put it to some good use. Here's the link to my very first sketch to be hosted on the world wide web :

[http://kevinkoder.hostei.com/test.htm](http://kevinkoder.hostei.com/test.htm)

Just a few sentences thrown all over the canvas and playing hide and seek in the snow. Nothing much really. Â Oh, and here's the link to the source :

[http://kevinkoder.hostei.com/data\_menu/fading\_menu.pde](http://kevinkoder.hostei.com/data_menu/fading_menu.pde)

If you have a slow connection please wait a bit. The music is around 250 kb. Also, text looks a bit drab because I couldn't get the fonts to work properly with processing.js

And the link to processing tutorial is inside the canvas. Happy hunting ;)
