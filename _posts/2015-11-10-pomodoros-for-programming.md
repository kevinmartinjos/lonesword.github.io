According to lifehacker, [the pomodoro technique](http://lifehacker.com/5890829/most-popular-productivity-method-the-pomodoro-technique?trending_test_d&utm_expid=66866090-62.H_y_0o51QhmMY_tue7bevQ.4&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.in%2F) came out as the most popular productivity method. I've been using this neat little technique since college. And now work. Pomodoros for exam prep was easy - you sit in front of the book while the clock is ticking and you go for a walk when it isn't. But using pomodoros for programming turned out to be slightly more complicated that. Here's what I found:

  1. Do NOT use pomodoros for debugging. You cannot estimate when you will figure out what is causing that bug. It can take anything between 2 hours to 2 days.

  2. Do not use pomodoros to set up your dev environment. You can install visual studio and SQL server while wading through nonsense at /r/nonsense. Save up your pomodoros for tasks that actually require focus.

  3. Set aside pomodoros for thinking. Saves a lot of time later.

  4. Your pomodoros will be interrupted. That's okay.

  5. Reply to emails on pomodoro breaks. If there are no emails to reply, take a walk.

  6. It's okay to extend your 5 minute break by another 2 minutes.

  7. I've never been able to do those 4 pomodoros in a row and take the bigger 15 minutes break. I don't think anyone can do that.

  8. You can't do 14 programming pomodoros a day. If you can do 8 a day, fantastic - you've done a lot of work. 6 Pomodoros, is *good*. I think anything more than 8 means you will be staying late in the office. That's okay too. The thing is, if you do not count all the debugging and email-replying and loitering-around and still managed to tick away more than 5 pomodoros, it's not a wasted day.

  9. The real *reward* of using pomodoros is not that you do more work per day, but that you can now *measure* how much work you do. If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.

  10. [kanbanflow](https://kanbanflow.com/) is a pretty good tool with a built-in timer. Arguably better than pen and paper. But ticking off pomodoros on a big white board is more satisfying.

  My two cents.
